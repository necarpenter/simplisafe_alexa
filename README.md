# simplisafe_alexa

Alexa skill to control SimpliSafe security system. 

Currently uses curl at the OS level as a BASH command to submit HTTP POST to Simplisafe mobile app. Requires a subscription to their mobile app to work.  

Planning to build this out to include a full library for API and more functionality on the Alexa skill.
